    Dear Mr. Smith,
    
    Re: Johnson v. Thompson Construction Ltd - Case No. 2024-CV-1234
    
    I am writing on behalf of my client, Sarah Johnson, regarding the breach of contract 
    that occurred on 15th March 2024. Ms. Johnson entered into an agreement with 
    Thompson Construction Ltd on January 10, 2024, for renovation work at her property.
    
    The main issues are:
    1. Whether Thompson Construction breached the contract by failing to complete work by the deadline
    2. The extent of damages suffered by Ms. Johnson due to the delay
    3. If the force majeure clause applies to this situation
    
    Dr. Michael Roberts, an expert witness in construction disputes, examined the property 
    on April 3rd, 2024. His report, dated April 10, 2024, confirms significant delays.
    
    A meeting was held on 25/03/2024 between Mr. James Thompson (Director of Thompson Construction), 
    Ms. Johnson, and myself. During this meeting, Mr. Thompson admitted the delays but disputed liability.
    
    The deadline for response is May 15, 2024. Please ensure your client's position is 
    communicated by this date.
    
    Yours sincerely,
    Robert Williams
    Solicitor
    Williams & Associates LLP
