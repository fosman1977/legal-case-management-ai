# Complete Working Solution - Test Guide

## What's Been Fixed

### 1. ✅ Text Extraction (Real Content)
- EnhancedDocumentProcessor now extracts real text from uploaded files
- Supports .txt files (fully working)
- Supports .pdf files (basic extraction)
- Debug logging shows extracted text

### 2. ✅ Entity Detection (Real Entities)
- BulletproofAnonymizer now detects:
  - Person names (John Smith, ABC Corporation)
  - Company/Organization names
  - Dates in multiple formats
  - UK legal terms and courts
  - Financial amounts
  - Party labels (Party A, Party B)

### 3. ✅ Contradiction Detection
- LocalContradictionDetector uses real patterns:
  - Timeline contradictions (conflicting dates)
  - Financial contradictions (different amounts)
  - Factual contradictions (conflicting statements)

### 4. ✅ Relationship Mapping
- LocalRelationshipMapper extracts real relationships between detected entities

### 5. ✅ Timeline Extraction
- LocalTimelineAnalyzer extracts real dates and events from document

## Test Instructions

1. **Upload test-legal-doc.txt** which contains:
   - Names: John Smith, ABC Corporation
   - Dates: January 15, 2023, February 15, 2023, etc.
   - Legal terms: contract, breach, defendant, plaintiff
   - Contradictions: "unforeseen circumstances" vs force majeure clause

2. **Click "Analyze Documents"**

3. **Expected Results:**
   - Entities detected: Should show real count (10+ entities)
   - Contradictions: Should find the force majeure contradiction
   - Timeline: Should extract real dates from document
   - Relationships: John Smith vs ABC Corporation

## Console Debug Output

You should see:
- `🔍 EnhancedDocumentProcessor - Reading text file`
- `🔍 EnhancedDocumentProcessor - Text extracted: CONTRACT DISPUTE ANALYSIS...`
- `🔍 AnalyzeSection - result.anonymization: {detectedEntities: Array(X)}`
- `🔍 AnalyzeSection - entityCount: [real number > 0]`

## What You'll See in UI

- **Strategic Analysis**: Real entity count, real contradiction count
- **Timeline Events**: Actual dates from your document
- **Relationships**: Real party relationships
- **Recommended Actions**: Based on actual document content
