# ðŸš€ Legal Case Management AI - Final Setup Instructions

## What You Need To Do On Your Mac

Since I can't directly create files on your device, here's the complete solution:

### Option 1: GitHub Setup (Recommended)

**Step 1: Create GitHub Repository**
1. Go to: https://github.com/new
2. Repository name: `legal-case-management-ai`
3. Description: `Professional AI-powered legal case management desktop application`
4. Make it **Public**
5. **DO NOT** initialize with README, .gitignore, or license (we have them)
6. Click "Create repository"

**Step 2: Copy Files to GitHub**
You have the complete Git repository ready in this environment at:
`/project/workspace/legal-case-management-ai-export/`

Since the Git push timed out, you'll need to:
1. Download/copy all files from the export directory
2. Push them to your new GitHub repository

**Step 3: On Your Mac Terminal**
```bash
cd ~/Documents
git clone https://github.com/YOUR-USERNAME/legal-case-management-ai.git
cd legal-case-management-ai
./install.sh
```

**Step 4: Start Application**
```bash
npm run electron-dev
```

**Step 5: Enable Auto-Sync**
```bash
./sync-config.sh setup
./sync-config.sh watch &
```

### Option 2: Direct File Copy

If you prefer not to use GitHub:

**Step 1: Create Project Directory**
```bash
mkdir -p ~/Documents/legal-case-management-ai
cd ~/Documents/legal-case-management-ai
```

**Step 2: Copy All Files**
You'll need to copy all files from `/project/workspace/legal-case-management-ai-export/` to your local directory.

**Step 3: Install and Run**
```bash
npm install
npm run electron-dev
```
