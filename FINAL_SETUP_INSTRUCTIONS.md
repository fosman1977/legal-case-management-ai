# Start services
docker compose -f docker-compose.minimal.yml up -d

# Stop services
docker compose -f docker-compose.minimal.yml down

# View logs
docker logs localai
```

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

**LocalAI not responding:**
```bash
# Restart LocalAI
docker compose -f docker-compose.minimal.yml restart

# Check logs for errors
docker logs localai
```

**Port conflicts:**
```bash
# Check what's using ports
netstat -tlnp | grep :8080  # LocalAI
netstat -tlnp | grep :5174  # Web app

# Kill conflicting processes
lsof -ti:5174 | xargs kill -9
```

**Model download issues:**
```bash
# Check available disk space
df -h

# Clean Docker if needed
docker system prune -a
```

**Application won't start:**
```bash
# Clean and reinstall
npm run clean
npm install
npm run build
```

## Security & Privacy

### Air-Gap Verification
To verify complete air-gap operation:
```bash
# Block internet access temporarily
sudo ifconfig en0 down

# Application should still work fully
# Only external CDN requests should fail (which we'll fix)
```
