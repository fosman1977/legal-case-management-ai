# 📋 WEEK 2: DISTRIBUTED PROCESSING TASKS

## 🎯 Milestone: M1.2 - Parallel Processing System

### ✅ Already Completed (from Week 1 overachievement):
- [x] Multi-worker pool implementation
- [x] Basic memory management
- [x] Checkpoint system foundation

### 🔄 Week 2 Focus Areas:

#### 1. MEMORY-BOUNDED STREAMING PROCESSOR
**File:** `src/core/streaming-processor.ts`
- [ ] Implement streaming document reader
- [ ] Chunk-based processing for large files
- [ ] Memory pressure backpressure system
- [ ] Garbage collection optimization

#### 2. BACKGROUND PROCESSING SERVICE
**File:** `src/services/background-processor.ts`
- [ ] Service worker implementation
- [ ] Queue persistence during UI inactive
- [ ] Progress state management
- [ ] Auto-resume on reactivation

#### 3. ENHANCED PROGRESS TRACKING
**File:** `src/core/progress-tracker.ts`
- [ ] Granular progress per document
- [ ] ETA calculation improvements
- [ ] Progress persistence
- [ ] UI progress synchronization

#### 4. WORKER HEALTH MONITORING
**Enhance:** `src/workers/enterprise-worker-pool.ts`
- [ ] Memory leak detection
- [ ] Performance degradation alerts
- [ ] Automatic worker restart
- [ ] Health metrics dashboard

### 📊 Week 2 Success Criteria:
- Process 10GB+ case folder without crashing
- Memory stays under 2GB during streaming
- Background processing continues when UI closed
- Progress accurately tracked and resumable
- 99.9% reliability (no crashes in 1000 operations)

### 🔧 Implementation Order:
1. **Day 1-2:** Streaming processor implementation
2. **Day 3-4:** Background service setup
3. **Day 5:** Progress tracking enhancements
4. **Day 6:** Integration testing
5. **Day 7:** Performance optimization
