    RESPONSE TO BREACH NOTICE
    
    Date: September 1, 2023
    To: TechCorp Inc.
    From: Digital Solutions LLC
    Re: Response to Breach Notice dated August 15, 2023
    
    Dear TechCorp Inc.,
    
    We acknowledge receipt of your breach notice dated August 15, 2023. We respectfully 
    dispute the allegations and provide the following response:
    
    1. DISPUTED SERVICE LEVEL FAILURES
    - July downtime was due to scheduled maintenance properly noticed per Section 6.2
    - August outage was caused by unprecedented DDoS attack affecting multiple providers
    - Our monitoring shows 99.7% average uptime over the contract period
    
    2. FORCE MAJEURE DEFENSE
    The August service interruption qualifies as a force majeure event under Section 12 
    of the Agreement, specifically:
    - Cyber attacks beyond our reasonable control
    - Regional internet infrastructure failures
    - Government-mandated security responses
    
    3. DISPUTE OF DAMAGES
    - Claimed revenue losses are not proximately caused by our services
    - TechCorp's own system failures contributed to downtime
    - Emergency service costs were excessive and unreasonable
    
    4. CURE MEASURES UNDERTAKEN
    We have implemented additional security measures including:
    - Enhanced DDoS protection systems
    - Redundant server configurations
    - Improved monitoring and alert systems
    
    We remain committed to fulfilling our obligations under the Agreement and 
    request good faith negotiations to resolve this dispute.
    
    Sincerely,
    Legal Counsel
    Digital Solutions LLC
