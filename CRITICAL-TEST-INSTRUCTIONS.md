# 🚨 CRITICAL TEST INSTRUCTIONS

## Current Issue
The console shows `analysisResults: null` which means **no analysis is happening**.

## Required Steps (EXACT ORDER)

### Step 1: Navigate to Analyze Section
- Click "Analyze" in the main navigation

### Step 2: Upload Document
- Click "Browse Files" or drag/drop
- Select `test-legal-doc.txt`
- File should appear in document queue

### Step 3: **CRITICAL STEP** - Start Analysis
- **Click the "Analyze Documents" button** (this button only appears after uploading files)
- This triggers the real analysis pipeline
- You should see console logs: `🔍 AnalyzeSection - raw results before aggregation`

### Step 4: Auto-Navigation to Insights
- App should automatically navigate to Insights section
- You should see: `🔍 InsightsSection - Auto-populating consultation results`

## Expected Console Output (In Order)
1. `🔍 AnalyzeSection - raw results before aggregation`
2. `🔍 AnalyzeSection - aggregated data`
3. `🔍 AnalyzeSection - created realResults`
4. `🔍 SimplifiedBarristerApp - received results from AnalyzeSection`
5. `🔍 InsightsSection render - analysisResults: [object with data]`
6. `🔍 InsightsSection - Auto-populating consultation results`

## What You Should See
- Executive Summary tab with strategic analysis
- Case Strategy, Timeline Analysis, Recommended Actions tabs
- Analysis metrics showing entities, contradictions, relationships

## If Still No Results
The issue is in the analysis pipeline - the "Analyze Documents" button is not triggering properly or the enhanced analysis is not creating results.
