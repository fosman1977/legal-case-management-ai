- Real-time memory and CPU monitoring
- Automatic memory management and garbage collection
- System resource threshold detection
- Performance metrics collection for legal processing

**Key Features:**
- Memory usage alerts before 2GB limit
- Processing queue throttling based on resources
- Performance analytics for optimization

### **TASK 3: Enterprise Database Schema (Priority 3)**
**File:** `src/database/enterprise-schema.sql`
**Requirements:**
- Extend current SQLite schema for enterprise features
- Tables for legal entities, relationships, case analysis
- State persistence for large case folder processing
- Incremental processing state management

**Legal Intelligence Schema:**
```sql
-- Tables for legal entities and relationships
CREATE TABLE legal_entities (...);
CREATE TABLE case_analysis (...);
CREATE TABLE document_relationships (...);
CREATE TABLE processing_state (...);
```

### **TASK 4: Worker Pool Architecture (Priority 4)**
**File:** `src/workers/enterprise-worker-pool.ts`
**Requirements:**
- Multi-worker pool for parallel processing
- Separate pools for extraction, OCR, AI analysis
- Legal analysis worker pool foundation
- Dynamic worker allocation based on task type

---

## 🔧 INTEGRATION REQUIREMENTS

### **Existing System Integration:**
1. **Document Extractor Integration:**
   - Enhance `productionDocumentExtractor.ts` to work with enterprise queue
   - Maintain backward compatibility with current API
   - Add legal intelligence extraction hooks

2. **AI Analysis Integration:**
   - Extend `optimizedAIAnalysis.ts` for enterprise processing
   - Add legal-specific analysis methods
   - Prepare for advanced legal reasoning integration

3. **Case Scanner Integration:**
   - Modify `caseFolderScanner.ts` to use enterprise queue
   - Add legal document categorization
   - Include legal entity pre-processing

### **Future Legal Intelligence Hooks:**
```typescript
// Integration points to build now for future legal AI
interface LegalIntelligenceHooks {
  onDocumentProcessed: (doc: ProcessedDocument) => Promise<void>;
  onEntityExtracted: (entity: LegalEntity) => Promise<void>;
  onCaseAnalysisNeeded: (documents: ProcessedDocument[]) => Promise<void>;
  onLegalValidationRequired: (analysis: LegalAnalysis) => Promise<void>;
}
```
